# Digit-Recognition

The data set comes from the Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition. The goal is to recognize digits 0 to 9 in handwriting images. Because the original data set is too large to be loaded in Weka GUI, I have systematically sampled 10% of the data by selecting the 10th, 20th examples and so on. You are going to use the sampled data to construct prediction models using naiÌˆve Bayes and decision tree algorithms. Tune their parameters to get the best model (measured by cross validation) and compare 
which algorithms provide better model for this task.

Due to the large size of the test data, submission to Kaggle is not required for this task. However, 1 extra point will be given to successful submissions. One solution for the large test set is to separate it to several smaller test set, run prediction on each subset, and merge all prediction results to one file for submission. You can also try use the entire training data set, or re-sample a larger sample.
